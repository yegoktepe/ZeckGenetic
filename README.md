Fibonacci encoded Zeckendorf representations in Genetic algorithm


Genetic algorithms are a prevalent tool for addressing intricate optimization problems. 

This research presents a novel genetic algorithm model that employs Fibonacci encoding and k-Zeckendorf representations to refine chromosome representation in optimization tasks. 

The primary aim is to hasten chromosome convergence toward global maximum/minimum values. 

The model is rigorously evaluated across a spectrum of optimization challenges, including those involving higher-degree polynomials and maximum volume, and is compared against the traditional genetic algorithm approach. 

The outcomes highlight the substantial enhancement in chromosome representation efficacy achieved through Fibonacci encoding and Zeckendorf representations, thereby enhancing the overall performance of genetic algorithms. 

This study underscores the prospect of further investigation and application of Fibonacci numbers and Zeckendorf representations in the domain of genetic algorithms.

About The Codes

The file named abc contains the codes written for the 5th degree polynomial problem. When the codes are run, the "initial.py" file is called to initialize the variables and values used in the program.
